-------------------------------------------

00-printname.c
This func passes a string(its arg) into funcs(w matching signature) pointed to by a func ptr(2nd arg).

01-iterator.c
This function iterates through an array of ints that has a known size, then passes the values in the array into a function pointer.

02-intfind.c
This func looks through an array of int and passes it into a func ptr that'll return 1 if it matches. Then the intfind will return the index of the int.
